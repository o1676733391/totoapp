- **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are stored in MongoDB Atlas (cloud database) for reliability and accessibility.
- **Three Views:**
  - **Tasks View:** List and manage all tasks.
  - **Focus Timer:** Pomodoro timer to boost focus and productivity.
  - **Progress View:** Visual stats and analytics of completed, pending, high-priority, and due-today tasks.
- **Time/Date Handling:** Each task can have a due date. The app highlights tasks due today and tracks completion over time.
